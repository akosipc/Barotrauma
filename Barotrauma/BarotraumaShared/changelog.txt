---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.10
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.9
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions and changes:
- New control scheme: items are selected by left clicking, deselected with right click or esc, and held
items are used on devices by pressing E (e.g. when rewiring with a screwdriver or repairing something 
with a wrench). The new controls are somewhat experimental; the intention is to make them more intuitive
to new players. You can still switch back to the legacy control scheme from the game settings.
- Set default radio chat keybind to R and creature attack keybind to Mouse3.
- MODDERS, PLEASE NOTE: Moved crafting recipes from the fabricator xml to the xmls of the items. Makes it 
possible for modders to add new craftable items without having to modify the fabricators.

- Camera movement is disabled completely when an item interface is open (not just when the cursor is on 
the interface).
- Option to disable the camera pan/zoom effects from the game settings.

- Allow aiming on ladders when not moving.
- Characters play Entrance of the Gladiators on the guitar when wearing a clown mask.
- Display a warning on the status monitor when docked to an outpost ("Docked to X, undock before attempting 
to maneuver the submarine").

meet.
- The server gives the "None" permissions to new clients, allowing server hosts to automatically give 
specific permissions to all clients.
- Increased submarine masses to make it less easy for characters to push them around.
- Ping direction is shown on the sonar display when adjusting the direction slider even if directional ping 
is not enabled.
- Tweaked charybdis' AI, attacks and animations.

- Added blood particle effects when under high pressure.
- Some optimization to reduce loading times.
- Added a search bar to fabricators.
- Increased the range of docking port sounds and added a subtle camera shake when locking the ports to make 
it more noticeable when a sub docks.
- Made all new medical items fabricable.
- Automatically put the currently equipped item in the inventory (no matter if it's one or two handed) when 
picking up items that require two hands. 
- Job preferences can be edited mid-round in the info menu.
- Slightly reduced the amount of oxygen characters consume from hulls.
- Enemies don't attack outposts or targets inside it anymore.

Multiplayer fixes:
- Fixed characters retaining the last known inputs when a client disconnects, causing the character to
keep welding, honking a bike horn or whatever else they were doing until the server kills the character.
- More reliable throw StatusEffect (= grenade explosion) syncing. Fixes clients not seeing explosions
at their end.
- More reliable item wall attaching syncing. 
- Servers don't attempt to send position updates for items that have no enabled physics body (e.g. attached 
items). Fixes "received a position update for an item with no physics body" console errors when attaching
items to walls.
- Fixed spectate button staying visible when a round ends while a client is in the lobby.
- Fixed remote characters sliding slowly to the left client-side when standing in place.
- Fixed server creating "attempted to create a network event for an item that hasn't been fully initialized 
yet" console errors when spawning LightComponents mid-round.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed wire connections that have been done mid-round not working properly.

- Fixed linked subs not getting docked correctly when loading a saved game.
- Fixed turrets not working if they're placed inside the submarine.
- Fixed calyxanide not being usable in syringe guns.
- Explosive harpoons disappear after exploding.

- Fixed crashing if none of the selected content packages contain location portraits suitable for the main menu.
- Fixed projectiles not applying status effects on impact if they have no attack defined.
- Fixed thorium rods not being usable in the reactor.

checking if a character doesn't have a StatusEffect with a "poison" tag returns true even if the character 
has no active StatusEffects).
- Fixed severed limbs occasionally noclipping into the submarine.
- Fixed large engine emitting smoke before it becomes repairable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.8
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions and changes:
- Improved tutorial - better videos, instructional texts, objective list that suggest what you should do 
next, option to rewatch the videos and re-read the instructions.
- Overhauled charybdis (still a work in progress though).
- Automatically grab adjacent ladders when the top/bottom of the current ladder is reached. Makes moving 
through docking ports a little less confusing. 
- Option to configure when afflictions become visible with the health scanner by adding 
a "ShowInHealthScannerThreshold" attribute to the affliction.
- Added labels next to periscopes in Humpback and Dugong.
- Modified Humpback's bilge to make it easier for AI characters to fix.
- Enemies can now navigate out from the sub when escaping.
- Bunch of tweaks to monster AIs (targeting priorities, attack cooldowns, etc).
- Made InventoryIconColor and ContainerColor properties saveable.
- Removed descriptive name from alien artifacts (so be extra careful when bringing them on board).
- Allow panning the campaign map with WASD.
- Allow editing selected wires in wiring mode (so it's possible to, for example, modify the colors of
the wires without having to disconnect them).
- Decreased structure damage done by frag grenades and made them disappear after they've exploded.
- Batteries output charge values as integers.
- Made damaged junction boxes less sensitive to overvoltage. Nearly broken junction boxes were barely able 
to handle any overvoltage, leading to chain reaction where one junction box breaking causes the grid to be 
overloaded, and the rest of the boxes start taking damage at an increasing speed.
- Reactors don't cool down when underwater anymore.
- Removed minimum conditions from battery deconstruction output (= deconstructing an empty battery still 
gives the materials used to craft the battery).
- Made a bunch of ItemContainer UI panels larger.
- Items can be dragged and dropped directly from the inventory into containers without having to select 
the container first.
- Plants can be picked up from the environment without any tools.
- Added more help texts to highlighted items ("[E] Interact", "[E] Climb"...)

Multiplayer fixes:
- Changes to event syncing logic to prevent cases where clients fall behind the server and get kicked out
due to the server not being able to send out network events to the clients fast enough.
- Networking optimizations that prevent level objects and continuously deteriorating items from creating
excessive amounts of network events.
- Fixed windows clients being unable to start a campaign in servers running on Linux.
- Fixed clients being unable to start a campaign using a submarine that's not in the default Submarine
folder at the server's side.
- Fixed loading submarine files and campaign saves occasionally failing when running multiple instances
of the game from the same install location (for example, a dedicated server executable and a client 
executable).
- Don't transfer files through the network when sending them to the owner of the server (i.e. a client 
hosting directly from the main executable).
- Fixed fires and water occasionally getting out of sync between a client using the fire/water console
commands and the server.
- Fixed clients disconnecting with an "unknown object header" error if they fail to read a network event
(when they should instead report the error to the server and wait for a message that contains a more
descriptive error).
- Campaign fix: clear missions from locations that change their type, and all adjacent locations. Not 
clearing them caused missions to still be available when they logically shouldn't be (e.g. a transport 
mission from an uninhabited location to another) and syncing issues in multiplayer.
- Disable campaign start button if a round is already running when joining.
- Fixed clients being unable to end campaign rounds at all if the sub isn't at the start/end outpost 
(regardless if they have the permission to end the round or not).
- Fixed campaign characters still being displayed in the server lobby after the game mode has been 
changed to something else.
- Fixed items in the characters inventory always starting at 100% condition client-side even if they had 
deteriorated during the previous round.
- Fixed LevelResource (mineral, plant, etc) deattach timers not being synced with clients.
- AI characters can take out excess fuel rods from the reactor when needed.
- Item interfaces and the health interface can be closed with Esc.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed almost all items using default repair duration values (10 seconds with high skills, 100 seconds
with low skills) instead of the ones configured in the item XMLs.
- Nuclear shells and nuclear depth charges disappear after they've exploded. 
- Fixed "trying to add a dead character to crewmanager" errors when attempting to revive a character 
killed by some other affliction than internal damage, bleeding or burns.
- Take the position of a sub's docking port into account when determining where to place outposts.
Previously the outposts were simply placed midway between the adjacent walls, which occasionally caused
problems with submarines whose docking port is close to the bow or tail.
- Fixed a bug in relay components that caused a bunch of issues in power grids that utilize relays:
Relays would receive the full amount of power from the grid regardless of the load of the devices
connected to the power_out connection, causing unnecessary overloads and fires.
- Fixed batteries being able to draw power through relay components that are connected directly to 
a power source, even if the relay isn't on.
- Don't allow steering the sub with WASD when a textbox is selected.
- Use the SpriteColor of the item when drawing the moving parts of turrets and doors.
- Fixed steering issues that caused monsters to swim in an incorrect direction when they're targeting
something inside the sub.
- Fixed a crash due when scaling the Mudraptor.
- Fixed crashing if a character has neither a head angle or a torso angle configured.
- Fixed characters always being created in the default folder in the character editor.
- Monsters don't target doors/hatches at the exterior of the sub when inside or inner doors when outside.
- Don't display disabled limbs on sonar (i.e. severed limbs that have "faded out").
- Close the save/load dialogs when leaving the sub editor. Otherwise they'll still be visible when 
re-entering the editor, and saving at that point will overwrite the previously loaded sub with an empty one.
- Removing an item after it's been combined doesn't trigger the OnBroken StatusEffects (e.g. combining two 
half-full flash powder jars doesn't cause them to explode).
- Fixed welding tools and plasma cutters not hitting targets if the barrel is inside the target (e.g. if
trying to weld a completely broken wall with the cutter partially inside the wall).
- Fixed very small mineral colliders that made them extremely hard to hit with the plasma cutter.
- Fixed items with no sprite crashing the game (now they just cause a console error).
- Don't allow autointeracting with contained items (e.g. picking up an ammunition box from a loader) 
if another item is currently selected. Makes it less likely for players to accidentally pick up items 
from containers when they deselect another item.
- Fixed characters not letting go of the character they're grabbing when the health interface is closed
by clicking outside the window.
- Fixed CrewManager throwing errors if changing resolutions when a crew member is dead.
- Fixed items emitting light from inside containers in the sub editor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additions and changes:
- The fission rate gauge on the reactor now visualizes the amount of fuel available.
- Doors and hatches can now also be repaired with wrenches.
- Changed default StatusEffect conditional comparison type back to OR.
- Clients communicate syncing errors to the server, and the server logs a more descriptive error about
what went wrong. Should make it easier to diagnose disconnection issues from now on.
- Ending a multiplayer campaign round by talking to watchman doesn't require any special permissions.
- Server automatically ends rounds if there have been no players alive in 60 seconds and respawning 
is not allowed during the round.
- Added a button for resetting an entity's properties to the default values to the sub editor.
- Updated handheld sonar UI graphics.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed non-radio chat/VOIP having an unlimited distance.
- Fixed a networking bug that caused the server to send item state changes to the clients before sending
a message about the item being spawned. For example, spawning any item with a LightComponent would always
cause clients to get disconnected.
- Changes to the way the clients are put in sync with the server when joining mid-round. Should make it 
less likely for clients to get disconnected immediately after starting a round.
- StatusEffects only apply non-limb-specific afflictions to one limb even if targeting the whole character. 
Fixes drugs like fentanyl and morphine being way too harmful due to the oxygen loss affliction being 
applied once per every limb. 
- Fixed TargetItemComponentName not working in StatusEffect conditionals (making it impossible to create
conditionals that target a specific component of an item).
- Made all of the new medical items combinable and usable in a syringe gun (assuming the drug is in a syringe).
- Fixed inability to throw anything in the multiplayer.
- Fixed multiplayer campaign setup UI showing the client's subs instead of the server's.
- Fixed campaign view button overlapping with the "ready to start" tickbox in the server lobby.
- Fixed sub/mode voting not being enabled when changing the setting after the server has been started.
- Fixed character inventories occasionally being saved incorrectly in the multiplayer campaign when an
- Fixed flares not activating by left clicking.
- Fixed affliction icons flickering rapidly in the health interface and above the health bar if their
strength is fluctuating around the threshold where the icon becomes visible.
- Fixed dedicated server crashing when typing in more text than can fit on one line. 
- Fixed enemies "fleeing" after they have been shot. There was a steering issue when they targeted characters 
inside the sub while being outside.
- Fixed Hammerhead attack causing warping.
- Fixed incorrect submarine and level seed in server logs when playing campaign mode.
- Hide the start button from the campaign UI if the client doesn't have the permission to manage 
the campaign or rounds.

- A major overhaul on the crew AI. They should now be much better at executing their tasks, keeping
themselves alive and less likely to get stuck.
- Re-enabled multiplayer campaign.
- New alien ruin art.
- New main menu (still a work in progress).
- New fonts.
- New subs and a new shuttle.
- New husk sprites.
- Improved item/character highlight effect.
- New signal items (divide, multiply, subtract, memory, equals, greater than, color, xor).
- Option to adjust microphone volume in multiplayer.
- Added a console commands for changing the gender and race of the character.
- More intuitive BrokenSprite condition logic: a BrokenSprite with a MaxCondition of 50 will start 
fading in at 50 (and be fully visible when the condition drops to 0 or down to the MaxCondition of 
the next BrokenSprite).
- Added Mirror X/Y buttons to editing HUDs and tooltips that tell about the keyboard shortcuts.

Multiplayer fixes:
- Improved item position syncing logic. Less warping or items being impossible to pick up due to
being in a different position server-side.
- Fixed clients not sending a network update to the server when dragging an item out of an inventory
slot, causing situations such as suffocation after dropping a diving suit due to the server not
knowing that you'd dropped it.
- The client hosting a server and spectators don't trigger autorestart.
- The owner of a server is allowed to spectate even if spectating is disallowed in server settings.
- Fixed "play yourself" always toggling to true when a round ends.
- Fixed missing item names in the extra cargo menu.
- Fixed traitor rounds failing to start if the server is not hosted by a client.
- Fixed console command aliases not being taken into account in GameClient.HasConsoleCommandPermission 
(meaning that the client needed a permission for each name variant of a command, making it impossible 
to for example use "fixwalls" instead of "fixhulls").
- Made the "control" console command usable to clients. 
- Show the "ready to start" tickbox in the server lobby even if the client has the permission to start 
the round.
- Fixed server lobby screen not showing the names of the submarines the client doesn't have.
- Fixed inability to select the respawn shuttle as a client host.
- Fixed VoipCapture creating new "could not start voice capture" popups constantly if there's no 
suitable capture device.
- Fixed crashing when starting a round if a submarine name contains underscores.
- Fixed clients console errors when attempting to modify the properties of an ItemComponent in-game
(for example, the color of a light component).
- Added some more information to the console messages and error popups when a client gets disconnected.
- Fixed enablecheats command crashing the server if it's used when there are no clients present.

Misc bugfixes:
- Audio fixes (less snap, crackle and pop).
- Fixed particle "jitter" when the submarine was moving fast.
- Fixed damage modifiers affecting all afflictions if they use affliction types instead of affliction 
identifiers. 
- Fixed end round vote text going outside the screen if there's a 2-digit amount of votes.
- Fixed StatusEffects only applying afflictions to one limb even if the target is "Character" instead of "Limb".
- Disable audio instead of crashing if no audio device is found.
- Fixed item interfaces getting repositioned every frame when the editing HUD is open.
- Fixed held items clipping with the sleeves of the character (e.g. when holding a revolver while an 
uniform is equipped).
- Fixed being able to levitate by spamming the ragdoll button.
- Fixed dead characters draining oxygen tanks inside diving suits/masks.
- Fixed reactor gauges getting messed up if the optimal fission rate is more than 100% (which may happen
if the power consumption is larger than what the reactor can generate).
- Fixed mud raptors not having an inventory (nor lootable items).
- Fixed inability to interact with any items when aim assist is set to 0%. 
- Fixed info panel flickering out and Tab getting "inverted" (= info panel shown when tab is not being held) 
when selecting crew members in the panel.
- Fixed characters arms occasionally getting stuck above their shoulders.
- Fixed wire nodes occasionally being created at the wrong end of a wire (e.g. when moving a wire between 
connections in a connection panel, the wire stretched from the device at the other end of the wire to 
the device that's being rewired).

Misc:
- Changed the way arguments are given to the "setclientcharacter" command (no semicolon to separate the 
names, quotation marks have to be used for multi-word names just like with any other command).
- Show the amount of credits in the crew tab of the campaign menu.
- Don't spawn new monsters if docked to the start outpost or within 50 meters of the start/end of the level.
- The diving knife now causes also internal damage besides bleeding.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

used to fetch the texts from the language files instead of the actual texts).
- Fixed AI orders that target a specific item (such as the order to power up the reactor) not working in
multiplayer.
- Fixed crashes when attempting to use voice capture or change voice capture settings when there are no 
suitable capture devices available.
- Fixed clients not being notified when an AI character shuts down the reactor.
- Fixed deconstructors staying active without power in multiplayer.

- Increased the impact tolerance of crawlers to prevent them from killing themselves by bumping into walls.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiplayer improvements:
- Got rid of the listen server: when hosting as a client, the game actually runs the dedicated server executable
in the background. Makes client-hosted servers a little smoother due to the better performance of the dedicated
server, and also makes it much easier for us to maintain and test the multiplayer because we no longer have
two separate server applications.
- Added multiplayer campaign.
- VOIP support! Still a work in progress, so minor audio glitches are to be expected.
- Improved character and submarine position syncing. Way less rubberbanding and teleporting!
- Fixed servers occasionally starting the round multiple times when autorestarting or starting by voting.
- Fixes players being unable to log in as a client when they're hosting a dedicated server on another machine.
- Option to randomize your job preferences in the server lobby.
- Fixed a server timing issue that occasionally caused the server to kick clients due to desync when a round starts.
- Fixed occasional server-side "maximum packet size exceeded" errors.
- Require the players to either dock with the ending outpost or to get the sub close and enter the outpost before 
automatically ending the round.

Bugfixes:
- Fixed crashing if the round ends while the health window is open.
- Fixed incorrect item panel positioning in the crew command interface when the sub is docked to something. 
- Fixed crashing when an incompatible content package is selected in config.xml or if the content package 
cannot be found.

- Fixed non-character key input on Linux (arrow keys, tab, etc).
- Fixed fullscreen option not taking effect on game launch.
- Fixes to a bunch of crashes in the character editor.
- Fixed subinventories not being displayed on the inner clothes slot, making it impossible to use the extra
slots in uniforms.
- Fixed game settings resetting every time the game is updated.
- Fixed bots shooting at their own crew with turrets.
- Fixed wifi components not receiving chat messages in single player.
- Fixed AI not reloading coilguns if an empty box of ammunition is inserted in the loader.
- Fixed incorrect deusizine scale.
- Fixed turret light toggle not doing anything.
- Fixed character skills that aren't defined in the job xml never increasing, resulting in all jobs except 
the captain always having a helm skill of 0.
- Fixed flashlight & scooter light cones being "clipped".
- Fixed StatusEffects bypassing limb damage modifiers.
- Fixed waypoints not getting connected between docking ports on some subs.
- Fixed target identifiers being bypassed when a StatusEffect is set to target nearby items or characters.
- Fixed the "insufficient skills to use the item" text popping up if a character doesn't have sufficient 
skills to operate one of the item's components, even if the component was not interacted with (e.g. captains 
got a warning about not being able to use the connection panel of a nav terminal, even if they didn't select 
the connection panel).

Steam Workshop:
- Update installed workshop items automatically on startup.
- Allow adding submarines to workshop items with the "add file" dialog.
- If creating an update for a workshop item that's currently installed, use the installed version instead 
of the one downloaded from the workshop.

Additions:
- Some new random events.
- A bunch of new afflictions and medical items.
- Some new item sprites.
- A couple of new cargo missions.
- Added some new items that can be crafted from alien materials.
- Display linked hulls as one room on the status monitor.
- Tons of new sound effects.
- Display the controlled character in the crew interface.
- Option to "give orders" to the character you're controlling. In single player it can be useful if you want 
the controlled character to keep doing something when switching to another one, in the multiplayer it can be 
used to let others know what you're doing.
- Added a weak spot to Moloch's bladder.
- Baby Moloch, doo doo doo doo doo doo 
- Added damage particles to Mud Raptors and Molochs.
- Added "minimum velocity" property to to motion sensors. Allows making sensors that, for example, keep a door open 
when a character is standing in the doorway.
- Option to choose whether to use AND/OR logic in StatusEffects with multiple conditionals. Defaults to AND.
- Added a 1 second "cooldown" to water detector state switches to prevent alarms from toggling on and off constantly 
when the water level is fluctuating around the position of the detector.
- Added scram option (reactor shutdown) to the nav consoles in the vanilla subs.
- Support for binding Mouse4, Mouse5 and MouseWheel.
- Made Hammerhead and Mudraptor attracted to light. 
- New husk sprite (still WIP).

Misc:
- Decreased deterioration rates across the board. Repairing a damaged item to full condition also now resets
the deterioration delay, meaning that the item will not start deteriorating again immediately after it's been
repaired.
- Miscellaneous optimization.
- Removed the info button from the top-left corner - the info menu is now opened with TAB.
- Changed default chat/radio keybinds to T and Y.
- Welding tools repair all the walls within the range of the raycast, not just the first wall the raycast hits. 
Makes it easier to repair overlapping and multi-layered walls.
- Decreased the range of passive sonar - previously there was often no reason to use the active sonar because
the passive mode showed the area around the sub so clearly.
- Health scanner shows all active afflictions (not just those that are visible in the health interface). 
Allows detecting afflictions at an earlier stage, making the item much more useful.
- Nerfed the structure damage done by Molochs and Crawlers.
- Reduced creature HP across the board.
- Increased the amount of minerals in levels.

that always does burn damage.
- Made headsets craftable.
- Battery output doesn't start dropping until the charge is below 10%.
- Restrict the amount of power going through relay components to the MaxPower value of the relay.
- Set Humpback reactor output a bit higher, batteries now start at full charge and relays can't be overloaded.
- Miscellaneous fixes and balancing to vanilla subs.

- Fixed fire sounds persisting in menus.
- Fixed the layout of the extra cargo menu in server settings.

- Fixes to "attempted to move pulljoint extremely far" errors which occasionally caused severe problems
in syncing characters' positions.
- Fixed a bug that occasionally caused monsters to spawn very close to the submarine in monster missions.
- Fixed servers occasionally starting the round multiple times when automatically starting the game via 
autorestart or clients being ready. 
- Fixed up-to-date content packages being reported as incompatible in the Steam workshop menu.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.9.1 (closed alpha)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Too many changes to list here. :) We've been working on this update for a year now, with a team of about 
a dozen people (as opposed to a couple of devs working on it on their free time).

Almost every aspect of the game has been improved to some extent - some polished a bit, some went through 
a more major overhaul and many things are completely new.

This is by no means a complete list, but here's some of the new things:

- A full graphics overhaul: almost all of the sprites has been polished or completely remade.
- Improved random event system that tries to keep the overall difficulty of the game at certain level,
delaying additional monster spawns if there's already lots of things going on, or spawning more when 
there's a more quiet moment.
- Improved difficulty system: now the difficulty level has a much more noticeable effect on the gameplay.
- General difficulty balancing all across the board: we've tried to make the difficulty curve more approachable
to new players while still keeping things challenging for more experienced players on higher difficulty levels.
- More varied levels, environmental hazards.
- A new more detailed health system with things such as limb-specific injuries, addictions, overdoses, 
mental issues... The system is also highly moddable, and makes it much easier to implement things such as
hunger mechanics, more varied poisons or stat-boosting items.
- Completely redesigned in-game HUD (the inventory, crew command interface, chat, etc).
- Redesigned crafting system.
- Minerals scattered across the level (can be used for crafting).
- A command/report system that can be used to communicate with your crew more effectively (in both single 
player and multiplayer).
- Tons of additions to alien ruins (traps, puzzles, non-flooded rooms).
- Improved AI (both the crew AI and the enemy AIs).
- NPC dialog (including random chatter and context-specific lines that make it easier to keep track of 
what the crew is doing).
- Most of the device interfaces have been redesigned to make them easier to use (and nicer to look at!).
- Many additions to the campaign mode (still a work in progress though).
- Overhauled the skill system: now every character can generally do anything (repair devices, fabricate 
new items, apply medical treatments), but characters with higher skill levels will do things more efficiently.
- Skill progression in the campaign mode: characters' skills gradually increase, making them more valuable with 
each completed round.
- New music composed specifically for the game.
- Overhauled audio.
- New monsters.
- New items (weapons, tools, medical items, alien items, crafting materials, etc).
- A completely remade tutorial.
- Too many bugfixes to count.
- Improved and much more stable ragdoll animations.
- Additional tools for modders (character editor, sprite editor, level editor, additions to the submarine editor).
- Steam functionality of course: full Workshop support, achievements, banning Steam IDs from servers...
- Improved translation support: it's possible to translate texts in item/job/etc configuration files without
breaking compatibility with existing subs or mods (see the EnglishVanilla file for some instructions).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.2.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Clients can now join servers that have an IPv6 address.
- Added "unban" and "unbanip" commands.
- Fixed a bunch of bugs that were causing "attempted to apply an invalid force/impulse to a physics body"
errors.
- Fixed a bunch of bugs that were causing "attempted to move a pulljoint extremely far" errors.
- Fixed DebugConsole selecting non-command lines if up/down is pressed when there are no commands in the 
console. 
- Fixed inventory syncing not working on the controlled character's inventory if the character is 
unconscious or wearing handcuffs.
- Verify that the launched exe belongs to the currently selected content package when starting up the game.
- Fixed console messages that have been created before initializing the debug console not being present
in crash logs. Made it difficult to diagnose crashes that occur immediately when the game starts.
- Additional error logging to diagnose SharpDX errors on startup.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.2.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed clients not seeing explosions from items that explode on impact or when their condition reaches zero.
- Fixed conditionals being ignored on delayed status effects.
- Fixed clients staying in an unsynced state if they rejoin while their character is dead or unconscious,
causing the camera not to follow the character and preventing the player from giving up.
- Fixed LightComponent sprites and broken device sprites not being mirrored in mirrored subs.
- Fixed a few ragdoll animation bugs that caused "attempted to move pulljoint anchor extremely far" errors.
- Fixed AI characters (most often mantises) being able to attack through walls.
- Fixed alien ruins occasionally overlapping with each other or being above the upper boundary of the level.
- Docking ports automatically stretch the hulls between them to cover the area between the docked subs. 
Otherwise there may be areas uncovered by hulls if the docking port is positioned slightly outside the 
extents of the submarine's hulls, causing characters to implode or get thrown back when they try to pass 
from sub to another.
- Fixed client-side docking ports creating duplicate bodies on doors, causing characters to collide with 
an invisible door when trying to move between docked subs (until the server forces them through it).
- Fixed characters occasionally getting teleported outside the sub for a few frames when moving between 
docked subs.
- Fixed status effects that deplete oxygen affecting characters that don't need air to breathe.
- More error logging to diagnose syncing errors.
- Melee weapons can only hit one character per swing (makes stun batons and medical syringes less OP).
- Option to make RegEx component only send a signal when it receives a signal (not continuously according 
to the last received signal).
- Added FalseOutput property to RegEx components.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.8.2.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Hitscan weapons like the revolver can hit targets outside the sub when firing from the inside and 
vice versa.
- Fixed crashing when attempting to clone linked submarines in the sub editor.
- Fixed crashing when attempting to clone items with non-default required items.

	- Fixed a bug in door syncing that caused the door states to differ between the server and clients 
	in some	subs with more complex door wiring setups.
	- Fixed clients being able to spam kick votes (duplicate votes were not counted but caused unnecessary 
	chat messages to be sent).
	- Fixed item conditions occasionally not matching exactly between the server and clients, causing 
	issues such as not clients not being able to fabricate items due to the condition being slightly 
	below the minimum condition at their end.

	in the inventory of the character detaching them).
	- Fixed items occasionally dropping instead of being moved to another inventory client-side.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed a memory leak in submarine preview images which caused crashes in the server lobby screen and
submarine editor.
- Fixed clients not seeing the "vote to end the round" tickbox if they don't have a character assigned to

- Fixed explosions with an EMP value only damaging reactors (when they should only ignore reactors).
- Fire can only explode oxygen tanks that are >25% full (otherwise the condition of the tank just drops 
to 0). Prevents infinite explosions when an oxygen generator is on fire with oxygen tanks inside.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Made ambient lighting much darker and added a subtle glow around the player.
- Made partially damaged walls leak much more slowly.
- Nerfed wall damage. Crawlers, mantises, threshers and coelanths now take much more time to tear through 
the hull and collisions with the level cause less damage.

in progress, but now it should be possible to translate most of the in-game texts without recompiling the game.
- Optimized rendering.

- More gore particles!
- Added a conditional system to status effects. Allows creating status effects that only have an effect
when a specific condition is met (e.g. health above a specific level, charge of an item high enough).
- Option to prevent status effects from stacking.
- Option to make status effects cancel other status effects.

Items:
	- Added syringe guns and a bunch of new chemicals.
	- Added ducts, switches and motion detectors.

	prevent multiple characters from cluttering the screen
	- Added "smallitem" tag to revolver rounds (can be placed in cabinets and pockets now).
	- Option to determine which types of targets a projectile can stick to.
	- Improved revolver hitscan logic.
	- Item descriptions can be changed in the submarine editor.
	- Characters can hold flashlights in their mouths.
	- Added an inventory slot for ID cards.

	show the name that's in the ID card the character is wearing. 
	- The owner of an ID card is stated in the description of the card.
	- Fabricating items requires the ingredients to have a specific minimum condition (can't use 
	already-used consumables to craft something).
	- Deconstructing an item that's not in a full condition may prevent some deconstruction products from appearing.
	- Optimized electricity/signal logic.
	- Grenades can be triggered by detonators.
	- Bought cargo spawns in containers instead of being scattered across the floor.
	- Players can't use other items when a railgun controller is selected. Prevents accidentally firing 
	weapons or hitting people with something while using the railguns.
	- Item editing menus display color values as 0-255 instead of 0-1.
	- Reactor temperature has to be critical for 30 seconds before the reactor explodes, giving the crew 
	more time to deal with griefers or incompetent reactor operators. The reactors also have an output 
	connection	that sends out a signal when the temperature is critical.

Multiplayer additions:
	- Added an optional "karma system". Harming other players, damaging structures and blowing up the reactor 
	reduces karma, while repairing things causes it to increase. A too low karma level prevents the players 
	from choosing specific jobs
	- Clients can be given permission to use specific console commands.
	- Client permission presets: the clients can be assigned as moderators or admins which have specific
	pre-configured permissions. New presets can be added by editing Data/permissionpresets.xml.

	secretly identify other traitors.
	- Added an option to make players spawn directly in the main submarine instead of the respawn shuttle.

	- Chat hotkey can also be used in the server lobby.
	- Added a [PM] tag to private chat messages.
	- Fixed game over/round end music not playing when a round ends.

	- Fixed wire nodes being impossible to select in the wiring mode if the nodes are exactly at the same position.
	- Fixed artifact holders being occasionally placed inside ruin doors and hatches.
	- Fixed particles in water being drawn under ruin structures, making it seem as if plasma cutters and
	welders weren't working.
	- Fixed all ruin structures having a health of 100.
	- Fixed OnActive status effects not being applied on powered items that don't require any power.
	- Fixed damage modifiers being applied multiple times when wearing an item that takes up multiple slots.
	Meaning that items such as the diving suit gave the players an excessive protection against damage.
	- Messagebox overflow fixes.
	- Fixed status effects not being able to decrease stun timers.
	- Fixed anti-husk medicine being able to reduce husk infection state after the infection has reached
	the active state.
	- Fixed monsters being able to spawn right next to the spawnpoint of the sub.
	- Fixed hulls not being linked to gaps if the center of the gap is exactly at the edge of the adjacent
	hulls.
	- Miscellaneous crew AI fixes.
	- Fixes to fast projectiles going through walls.
	- Fixed structure damage sounds not being played when a structure is fully destroyed.
	- Fixed glass windows using wrong sound effects.
	- Fixed carrier's light falling off when it dies.
	- Fixed incorrect positioning of debug console question prompts.
	- Fixed being able to use a wrench on multiple items at the same time.
	- Fixed double-clicking items in corpses putting them in their hands instead of your own inventory.
	- Fixed some level seeds generating a tiny enclosed cave that makes it impossible to reach the destination.
	- Fixed opened and broken doors being ignored during waypoint generation, causing waypoint connections 
	to go through doors which prevented AI characters from opening them.

	- Fixed modified wall colors only being visible in the submarine editor.
	- Fixed items being dropped when attempting to place them in an itemcontainer slot that's on a normal 
	inventory slot.

	- Fixed subinventory slots going outside the screen when highlighting an item such as a metal crate.
	- All creatures all cleared from the tutorial level to prevent any unintended monster attacks.
	- Fixed "constructing final path failed" pathfinding errors.
	- Fixed particles going through closed gaps (e.g. closed doors).
	- Fixed submarines being able to enter ruins.
	- Fixed collisions between a sub and the ruins not causing any damage to either the sub or the ruins.
	- Whitespace is ignored when calculating MD5 hashes for files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.7.0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added console commands for modifying client permissions.
- Fixed content package setting not being saved in the settings menu.
- Item pickup sounds are only played when the controlled character picks up an item.

- Updated the vanilla content package to version 0.7.
- Fixed entity linking in the submarine editor.
- Fixed railgun HUD crashing the game if the railgun is linked to an item that does not have an 
ItemContainer component (i.e. any item that can't contain other items).

- Fixed crashes when attempting to use a railgun controller that's not connected to anything.
- Fixed autorestart counter overlapping with the campaign map in the server lobby screen.
- Fixed characters receiving damage almost exclusively to their feet when wearing a diving suit.
- Armoring reduces damage by a certain percentage, not a fixed value. Now armor doesn't make characters
invulnerable to small amounts of damage.
- The effectiveness of different types of armor depends on the type of damage. For example, diving suits
provide fairly good protection against burn and slash damage, but aren't as affective against blunt damage.
- Fixed light sources attached to limbs not rotating with the limbs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.7.0.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- Minor particle optimizations.

Bugfixes:
	- Fixed the "DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED" crashes on specific GPUs when the loading reaches 80%.
	- Fixed crashes when projectiles stuck to items on dedicated server.
	- Fixed a bunch of bugs that caused crashes when a character was removed mid-round (for example when 
	a character turns into a husk).
	- Fixed a bug that occasionally caused swimming creatures to flip around constantly.
	- Fixed a bug that caused creatures to be able to sever limb joints that shouldn't be possible to sever,
	causing issues when attempting to sync the positions of the dead bodies.

Items:
	- Added battery recharge docks.
	- Added revolvers (the captain always spawns with one).
	- Added oscillators (a signal item that sends out a periodic pulse, a sine wave or a square wave).
	- Added "state_out" connections to relay components.
	- Added sprites for destroyed doors/hatches.
	- Added a HUD that shows the charge of the supercapacitors and the amount of shells left when using
	a railgun.

	items can't be accidentally dropped by releasing the mouse button between the slots.
	- Sounds for picking up and dropping items.
	- Medical scanner displays husk infections.
	- New C4, detonator and grenade sprites.
	- Optimizations and minor visual changes to the sonar display.
	- Support for hitscan projectiles.
	- Fixed ranged weapons launching projectiles with an incorrect rotation.
	- The spread of ranged weapons can be adjusted (separate values for normal spread and spread when 
	the item is being used by a character with an inadequate skill level).
	- Heavier harpoon gun recoil and impulse when the spear hits something.

- Improved item editing UI:
	- Number input fields for numeric values.
	- Separate number input fields for the components of vector values (instead of one text input box)
	- Color input fields display a preview of the currently selected color.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.6.1.4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Plasma cutters can cut alien ruins again.
- Fixed reactors staying operational after the fuel rods run out.
- Fixed spawning items at the cursor via the debug console.
- Fixed job assignment logic causing crashes if the maximum amount of players per job has been reached
on the top 3 preferences of a client (which can happen on modded servers that have several jobs with a 
player limit).
- Fixed errors during job assignment if a client or the host is controlling a non-human character.
- The server log menu remembers the state of the filters when toggling it.
- Fixed level generation errors in some specific seeds that caused the game to create ruin walls with
a negative width/height (example seed: cBLgZ2im).
- Fixed a submarine position syncing issue that caused erratic physics behavior on some specific 
multi-part subs, because the game only moved one part of the sub and the parts docked to it, not taking
into account that more parts may be docked to the docked parts.
- Handcuffed AI characters can't climb ladders.
- Fixed crashing when a huskified human is killed by an explosion.
- Added some GPU info to the crash reports and extra debug logging to hopefully diagnose the 
SharpDXExceptions during startup.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.6.1.3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed hulls not being rendered in the submarine editor.
- Crouching is synced between the server and the clients.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Support for multiple submarines (no full-fledged submarine vs submarine battles yet, but they're coming
in future updates!):
	- Submarine files can be "merged", i.e. submarines can consist of multiple separate parts which can
	be docked into each other
	- the multiplayer mode has a "respawn shuttle" which transports respawned players from the entrance
	to the main submarine
	- parts of the submarine and characters inside them can be left behind in the single player mode
	(and later salvaged if you wish to do so)

Multiplayer:
	- fixed a bunch of bugs that caused entity IDs not to match between the clients and the server (which
	caused severe syncing issues)
	- fixed monster inventory syncing (i.e. husk inventory syncing)
	- fixed server description box not being synced with clients
	- search bar for server logs
	- more server options
	- fixed the occasional "queue empty" error messages when attempting to send submarine files to players
	- characters can't be freely named anymore - they'll have the same name as the client

Items:
	- items can be equipped/unequipped by double clicking
	- longer railgun view distance
	- changes to the logic that determines which item is being highlighted - now it's much easier to
	select specific items in cramped subs
	- highlighted items glow (so it's easier to see which item you're targeting in the dark)
	- fixed an electricity bug that sometimes caused parts of the grid to not carry any power after 
	a junction box has been broken and repaired
	- option to choose the output of a signal check component when the signal doesn't match
	- fixed fire extinquishers

	- cameras: can be connected to a railgun controller (or any other selectable controller) to remotely
	view rooms or areas around the sub

	- the mass of a submarine depends on its size - larger submarines require more force to move around
	(custom subs may need some modifications to get the top speeds of the smaller/larger subs back to a
	steerable level)
	- changes to depth damage logic: structures with more health need more pressure before they start taking
	damage (i.e. submarines with thicker walls and no windows can go deeper)

Misc:
	- stunned characters can't move items in their inventory
	- characters can run while grabbing/dragging someone
	- fixed a bug that made it impossible to spawn characters through the console in the Linux version
